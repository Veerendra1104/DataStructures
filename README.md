Array Data Structure
Description
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming. They store a collection 
of elements of the same type in a contiguous memory block. Various operations, such as accessing,
updating, sorting, and searching elements, are essential for working with arrays. In this repository, 
multiple problems related to arrays are solved, covering different scenarios and algorithms.

Completed Problems (Arrays)
Here are the problems solved so far:

AverageArray.java
This program calculates the average of the elements in an array.

FirstSecBiggest.java
This program finds the first and second biggest elements in an array.

BigElement.java
This program identifies the largest element in an array.

NPNumCnt.java
This program counts the number of positive and negative numbers in an array.

PrimeCnt.java
This program counts the number of prime elements in an array.

EOSum.java
This program counts the number of even and odd numbers in an array.

SimpleReverseArray.java
This program reverses the elements of an array.

ElemExceptBigSmallElement.java
This program identifies all elements in an array except the biggest and smallest.

SmallElement.java
This program finds the smallest element in an array.

BigSmallElement.java
This program identifies both the biggest and smallest elements in an array.
